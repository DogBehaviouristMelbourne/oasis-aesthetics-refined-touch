# Project Cleanup Report

## Actions Taken
- Force closed all local dev servers (ports 5173, 5174).
- Ran ESLint to auto-fix and report code issues.
- Identified the following distractions and unused files:
  - MCP-related files: `src/pages/McpDemo.tsx`, `src/lib/mcp.ts`, `src/lib/mcp.config.ts` (not in use, MCP integration paused)
  - ESLint warnings in several UI files about exporting non-component code (see below for details)

## Recommendations
- Remove or archive MCP-related files if not needed.
- Address ESLint warnings in:
  - `src/components/ui/badge.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/form.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx`
  - `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx`
- Remove any other demo, test, or mock files not needed for production.
- Review and remove unused images or assets in `public/` if not referenced in code.

## Next Steps
- Delete MCP and demo files if you want a distraction-free, production-ready codebase.
- Optionally, split out shared constants/functions from UI component files to resolve Fast Refresh warnings.
